# Net-type classification data model — Verification

The net-types data model (`src/net_types.rs`) is the Wave 4 Phase 2
"contracts-as-pyo3-pyclasses" pivot: the first contract migration, ported
from `temper_placer/core/net_types.py` (the Python module is now a
pure-delegation re-export of the `temper_design_bundle_python` pyclasses).

## Induction applicability

**Mathematical induction is not applicable to this module.** None of its
functions are recursive and none iterate over a dimension whose correctness
depends on a size parameter:

- `get_clearance_mm` / `get_creepage_mm` are single table lookups with a
  constant multiplier — no loop, no recursion.
- `NetTypeSpec::validate` is a fixed sequence of four disjoint branch tests
  over a fixed field set — the number of error classes is constant.
- `classify_net` / `get_plane_nets` / `get_pour_nets` / `validate_all` /
  `from_yaml_config` iterate over caller-provided collections
  (specs/patterns), but the per-element operation is independent of the
  collection's size and of the iteration order (verified by MR2 in
  `test_net_types_pbt.py` — insertion-order permutation invariance). There
  is no size-parameterized invariant to induct on.

The module is data-only (enums, one frozen dataclass, one plain dataclass,
pure string-parse helpers). Per the plan's R1e, a **structural proof** is
recorded instead.

## Structural proof

**Claim (bit-identical parity).** For every public symbol, the pyclass
behaviour is bit-identical to the pinned pre-migration Python
implementation (`packages/temper-placer/tests/core/_net_types_py_oracle.py`,
commit `37a4251e0`).

*Proof by structural cases.*

1. **Enum tables (`get_clearance_mm`, `get_creepage_mm`).** Both sides are
   finite `match`/dict lookups over the same 5-member closed domain with the
   same base constants, scaled by the same IEEE-754 multipliers
   (`0.8 / 1.0 / 1.4 / 1.5`) for the same guard values. IEEE-754 double
   multiplication is deterministic across implementations, so each of the
   5 × 3 input combinations yields bit-identical doubles. Exhaustive
   coverage: the differential test drives every member × every degree/group,
   and P1/P1b re-assert the closed form independently.

2. **`validate` / `is_valid`.** The error corpus is produced by four
   pairwise-disjoint branch conditions, each transcribed verbatim from the
   oracle: (a) ground with non-plane/non-direct connectivity, (b) HV with
   creepage below the IEC minimum, (c) HV with clearance below the IEC
   minimum, (d) high-current or >5 A with `Via1x1`, (e) differential without
   impedance. Because the branches are disjoint, the output list is exactly
   the union of the firing branches — the same union the Python builds. The
   message text is byte-identical: enums format via the same
   `"MEMBER_NAME"` strings, and floats format with Rust `{:?}` (shortest
   round-trip) which equals Python `repr` for the closed set of values that
   can appear (the IEC table bases `{0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 1.6, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 8.0,
   14.0}` and caller-supplied mm/A values; all integral values gain `.0` in
   both). `is_valid` is the negation of the empty check in both sides.

3. **`classify_net`.** The triage is a deterministic first-match chain:
   explicit-spec lookup → ground patterns → power patterns → HV patterns →
   signal default. Both sides evaluate the same substring predicates on
   `net_name.upper()` in the same order; the returned spec is the same
   module constant (field-equal; the differential test documents that
   identity is not the contract). The pattern sets are the same six-element
   sets on both sides (the `frozenset`→`set` type change is documented and
   content-equal).

4. **`from_yaml_config`.** The mapping is a deterministic transcription of
   the oracle's per-rule default-resolution chain (`type` → class-name lower,
   `connectivity` → net-type default, HV `voltage_class` → `mains_240v`,
   `target_layer` → `LayerIndex` member, `max_current_a` →
   `max_current_rating` → 0.5, and the scalar defaults). The one non-obvious
   case — the `target_layer` default resolving to a `LayerIndex` IntEnum —
   is preserved exactly (not flattened to `int`) because
   `temper_placer/io/zone_manager.py` serializes the value with `str()` into
   the KiCad `(layer "…")` token; the pyclass imports
   `temper_placer.core.board` lazily at call time to construct the same
   IntEnum. This preserves the pre-migration observable behaviour
   (`str(LayerIndex.IN1_CU) == "In1.Cu"`), which a bare `int` would change
   to `"1"`.

5. **Module constants.** The four pre-defined specs (`GROUND_PLANE_SPEC` et
   al.) are built field-by-field from the oracle's literals; the differential
   test asserts field equality for all four.

## Evidence

- Differential (R1a/R1f, TDD red→green):
  `packages/temper-placer/tests/core/test_net_types_rust_differential.py`
  (43 assertions, oracle `_net_types_py_oracle.py`).
- PBT (R1c): `test_net_types_pbt.py` — 7 hypothesis properties
  (P1/P1b/P2/P3/P4/P5/MR1), vacuity-guarded.
- Metamorphic (R1d): `test_net_types_pbt.py` — MR1 (round-trip + kwarg-order
  commutativity), MR2 (insertion-order permutation invariance), MR3
  (from_yaml_config ≡ direct construction).
- Performance A/B (R1b): this is a pure-data contract migration with no
  compute kernel; the performance A/B is the "no regression beyond noise"
  comparison defined in the plan's R2 for delegation-only modules.

# Loop-centric data model — Verification

The loop data model (`src/loops.rs`) is the SECOND Wave 4 Phase 2
"contracts-as-pyo3-pyclasses" migration, ported from
`temper_placer/core/loop.py` (the Python module is now a pure-delegation
re-export of the `temper_design_bundle_python` pyclasses, mirroring the
net-types precedent).

## Induction applicability

**Mathematical induction is not applicable to this module.** None of its
functions are recursive and none iterate over a dimension whose correctness
depends on a size parameter:

- `estimated_inductance_nh` / `max_area_for_inductance_nh` /
  `voltage_spike_v` / `area_margin_pct` / `estimated_voltage_spike` are
  closed-form arithmetic — no loop, no recursion.
- `get_component_refs` / `involves_component` / `involves_net` and every
  `LoopCollection` query iterate over caller-provided lists, but the
  per-element operation is independent of the collection's size and of the
  iteration order (verified by MR2 in `test_loop_pbt.py` — insertion-order
  permutation invariance). There is no size-parameterized invariant to
  induct on.

The module is data-only (two string-valued enums, three dataclasses, one
container). Per the plan's R1e, a **structural proof** is recorded instead.

## Structural proof

**Claim (bit-identical parity).** For every public symbol, the pyclass
behaviour is bit-identical to the pinned pre-migration Python
implementation (`packages/temper-placer/tests/core/_loop_py_oracle.py`,
commit `76f38db0a`).

*Proof by structural cases.*

1. **Enum tables (`LoopType`, `LoopPriority`).** Both sides enumerate the
   same closed member sets with the same string values in the same order.
   `name`/`value` mirror the Python `Enum` accessors; `str(member)` is
   `"LoopType.COMMUTATION"` and `repr(member)` is
   `<LoopType.COMMUTATION: 'commutation'>` (the value is QUOTED — the
   string-valued-enum rendering, verified by the differential test).
   Value-based construction `LoopType("commutation")` resolves by value
   exactly as Python `Enum(value)` does, including the exact `ValueError`
   text `'<value>' is not a valid LoopType`. Members are NOT equal to
   their string value and are hashable (plain-Enum semantics; no `eq_int`).

2. **`LoopEvent` physics.** `estimated_inductance_nh` computes
   `mu_0 * (A·1e-6) / (h·1e-3) * 1e9` with `mu_0 = 4·π·1e-7` — the
   oracle's expression shape preserved verbatim (B7: same three-op chain,
   no reassociation, no fusing), so every input yields bit-identical
   doubles (asserted on `.hex()` keys). `max_area_for_inductance_nh` and
   `voltage_spike_v` are the corresponding closed forms with the same
   property. The `None`-lifecycle (all fields default `None`; `voltage_spike_v`
   returns `None` without `di_dt`) matches the oracle.

3. **`LoopPin`.** Three fields with the same defaults; `__str__` produces
   `"Q1.GATE"` / `"Q1.GATE (NET)"` byte-identically.

4. **`Loop`.** Construction mirrors the dataclass default chain
   (`pins`/`components`/`nets` empty, `max_area_mm2=100.0`,
   `priority=MEDIUM`, `events=LoopEvent()`, `return_layer`/`return_net`
   `None`, `source="manual"`). `get_component_refs` returns the
   `components` list verbatim when non-empty, else unique pin refs in
   first-appearance order (dedup via an insertion-ordered scan — same
   algorithm the oracle's `seen`-set loop implements). The area lifecycle
   (`set_current_area`/`get_current_area`/`is_area_compliant`/
   `area_margin_pct`/`estimated_voltage_spike`) reproduces the oracle's
   `None`-until-set semantics and its exact arithmetic
   (`(max - area) / max * 100`).

5. **`LoopCollection`.** Construction, `add_loop` (including the
   duplicate-name `ValueError` text), every query, `summary` (same keys,
   same values), `__len__`/`__iter__`/`__getitem__` (int with negative
   wrap, str by name, `KeyError`/`TypeError`/`IndexError`) all mirror the
   oracle. Loops are stored as `Py<Loop>` handles so mutation through
   `collection[name].set_current_area(...)` is visible to subsequent
   queries — the pre-migration stored the same mutable objects.

6. **Documented deviations.** (a) pyo3 pyclass enums cannot support
   class-level iteration (`for lt in LoopType:`); the enums expose a
   `members()` staticmethod (declaration order) and `io/loop_loader.py` —
   the only consumer that iterated — was adapted to use it,
   behavior-identically (same members, same order, same error text).
   (b) `add_loop`'s Python parameter is named `new_loop` in Rust (`loop`
   is a Rust keyword); all callers pass it positionally.

## Evidence

- Differential (R1a/R1f, TDD red→green):
  `packages/temper-placer/tests/core/test_loop_rust_differential.py`
  (55 assertions, oracle `_loop_py_oracle.py`).
- PBT (R1c): `test_loop_pbt.py` — 5 hypothesis properties (P1–P5),
  each with a `test_pN_fails_for_<mutant>` vacuity mutant (G4 pattern via
  `hypothesis.inner_test` against a degenerate kernel) plus a deterministic
  vacuity anchor (`test_p3_components_win_over_pins`).
- Metamorphic (R1d): `test_loop_pbt.py` — MR1 (construction→access
  round-trip + kwarg-order commutativity), MR2 (insertion-order
  permutation invariance of set-valued collection queries), MR3
  (`Loop.estimated_voltage_spike` ≡ chained `LoopEvent` computation,
  bit-exact).
- Performance A/B (R1b): pure-data contract migration with no compute
  kernel; the "no regression beyond noise" comparison defined in the
  plan's R2 for delegation-only modules applies.
